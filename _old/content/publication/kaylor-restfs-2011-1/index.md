abstract: We have designed and implemented RestFS, a software framework that provides
  a uniform, configurable connector layer for mapping remote web-based resources to
  local filesystem-based resources, recognizing the similarity between these two types
  of resources. Such mappings enable programmatic access to a resource, as well as
  composition of two or more resources, through the local operating system's standard
  filesystem application programming interface (API), scriptable file-based command-line
  utilities, and inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms. The framework supports
  automatic and manual authentication. We include several examples intended to show
  the utility and practicality of our framework.
