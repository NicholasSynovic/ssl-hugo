abstract: \"Progress in scientific research is dependent on the quality and accessibility
  of software at all levels\" (the overall premise of the workshop). We argue that
  true progress depends on embracing the best traditional–and emergent– practices
  in software engineering, especially agile practices that intersect with the tradition
  of software engineering. Software engineering as practiced today is more than the
  stereotypical monolithic lifecycle processes (e.g. waterfall, spiral, etc.) that
  historically have impeded progress for small/medium sized development efforts. In
  addition, the discipline and practice of software engineering includes software
  quality (with an established tradition of software metrics). Software processes
  can be pragmatic and use best features/practices of various models without impeding
  developer productivity. The embracement of these practices may also be important
  to prevent a brain drain of sorts, as students are increasingly eschewing traditional
  scientific/computation science research in favor of industry opportunities, where
  they can literally apply what they have learned in software development courses
  where pragmatic software engineering practices (e.g. test-driven design, RESTful
  architecture, etc.) are already prevalent.\"
