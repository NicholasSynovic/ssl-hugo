abstract: Efficient RDF, graph based queries are becoming more pertinent based on
  the increased interest in data analytics and its intersection with large, unstructured
  but connected data. Many commercial systems have adopted distributed RDF graph systems
  in order to handle increasing dataset sizes and complex queries. This paper introduces
  a distribute graph approach to pre-processing linked data. Instead of traversing
  the memory graph, our system indexes pre-processed join elements that are organized
  in a graph structure. We analyze the Dbpedia data-set (derived from the Wikipedia
  corpus) and compare our access method to the graph traversal access approach which
  we also devise. Results show from our experiments that the distributed, pre-processed
  graph approach to accessing linked data is faster than the traversal approach over
  a specific range of linked queries.
