abstract: This study explores the performance of modern, accurate machine learning
  algorithms on the classification of fossil teeth in the Family Bovidae. Isolated
  bovid teeth are typically the most common fossils found in southern Africa and they
  often constitute the basis for paleoenvironmental reconstructions. Taxonomic identification
  of fossil bovid teeth, however, is often imprecise and subjective. Using modern
  teeth with known taxons, machine learning algorithms can be trained to classify
  fossils. Previous work by Brophy et. al. 2014 uses elliptical Fourier analysis of
  the form (size and shape) of the outline of the occlusal surface of each tooth as
  features in a linear discriminant analysis framework. This manuscript expands on
  that previous work by exploring how different machine learning approaches classify
  the teeth and testing which technique is best for classification. Five different
  machine learning techniques including linear discriminant analysis, neural networks,
  nuclear penalized multinomial regression, random forests, and support vector machines
  were used to estimate these models. Support vector machines and random forests perform
  the best in terms of both log-loss and misclassification rate; both of these methods
  are improvements over linear discriminant analysis. With the identification and
  application of these superior methods, bovid teeth can be classified with higher
  accuracy.
