abstract: Processing visual data on mobile devices has many applications, e.g., emergency
  response and tracking. State-of-the-art computer vision techniques rely on large
  Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) that are usually too power-hungry to be deployed on
  resource-constrained edge devices. Many techniques improve DNN efficiency of DNNs
  by compromising accuracy. However, the accuracy and efficiency of these techniques
  cannot be adapted for diverse edge applications with different hardware constraints
  and accuracy requirements. This paper demonstrates that a recent, efficient tree-based
  DNN architecture, called the hierarchical DNN, can be converted into a Directed
  Acyclic Graph-based (DAG) architecture to provide tunable accuracy-efficiency tradeoff
  options. We propose a systematic method that identifies the connections that must
  be added to convert the tree to a DAG to improve accuracy. We conduct experiments
  on popular edge devices and show that increasing the connectivity of the DAG improves
  the accuracy to within 1% of the existing high accuracy techniques. Our approach
  requires 93% less memory, 43% less energy, and 49% fewer operations than the high
  accuracy techniques, thus providing more accuracy-efficiency configurations.
