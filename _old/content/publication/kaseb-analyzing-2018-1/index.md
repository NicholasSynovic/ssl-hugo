abstract: Millions of network cameras are streaming real-time multimedia content (images
  or videos) for various environments (e.g., highways and malls) and can be used for
  a variety of applications. Analyzing the content from many network cameras requires
  significant amounts of computing resources. Cloud vendors offer resources in the
  form of cloud instances with different capabilities and hourly costs. Some instances
  include GPUs that can accelerate analysis programs. Doing so incurs additional monetary
  cost because instances with GPUs are more expensive. It is a challenging problem
  to reduce the overall monetary cost of using the cloud to analyze the real-time
  multimedia content from network cameras while meeting the desired analysis frame
  rates. This paper describes a cloud resource manager that solves this problem by
  estimating the resource requirements of executing analysis programs using CPU or
  GPU, formulating the resource allocation problem as a multiple-choice vector bin
  packing problem, and solving it using an existing algorithm. The experiments show
  that the manager can reduce up to 61% of the cost compared with other allocation
  strategies.
