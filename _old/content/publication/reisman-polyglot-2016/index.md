abstract: As sequencing technologies continue to drop in price and increase in throughput,
  new challenges emerge for the management and accessibility of genomic sequence data.
  We have developed a pipeline for facilitating the storage, retrieval, and subsequent
  analysis of molecular data, integrating both sequence and metadata. Taking a polyglot
  approach involving multiple languages, libraries, and persistence mechanisms, sequence
  data can be aggregated from publicly available and local repositories. Data are
  exposed in the form of a RESTful web service, formatted for easy querying, and retrieved
  for downstream analyses. As a proof of concept, we have developed a resource for
  annotated HIV-1 sequences. Phylogenetic analyses were conducted for textgreater6,000
  HIV-1 sequences revealing spatial and temporal factors influence the evolution of
  the individual genes uniquely. Nevertheless, signatures of origin can be extrapolated
  even despite increased globalization. The approach developed here can easily be
  customized for any species of interest.
