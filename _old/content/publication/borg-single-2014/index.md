abstract: 'TEI is good at what it does: static documents rendered in glorious detail.
  But TEI is old. Its age doesn’t make TEI irrelevant, but it’s important to be conscious
  of how the way we weave the fabric of the web has changed since TEI was conceived
  in 1994, and reevaluate some of our assumptions about its use. In this early work,
  we are exploring this rethinking as part of a larger study within the center on
  general methods for isolating the complexity frequently associated with XML-based
  frameworks.'
