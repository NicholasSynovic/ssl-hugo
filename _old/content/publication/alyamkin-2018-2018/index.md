abstract: "Computer vision has achieved impressive progress in recent years. Meanwhile,\
  \ mobile phones have become the primary computing platforms for millions of people.\
  \ In addition to mobile phones, many autonomous systems rely on visual data for\
  \ making decisions and some of these systems have limited energy (such as unmanned\
  \ aerial vehicles also called drones and mobile robots). These systems rely on batteries\
  \ and energy efficiency is critical. This article serves two main purposes: (1)\
  \ Examine the state-of-the-art for low-power solutions to detect objects in images.\
  \ Since 2015, the IEEE Annual International Low-Power Image Recognition Challenge\
  \ (LPIRC) has been held to identify the most energy-efficient computer vision solutions.\
  \ This article summarizes 2018 winners' solutions. (2) Suggest directions for research\
  \ as well as opportunities for low-power computer vision."
