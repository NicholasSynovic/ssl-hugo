abstract: "Nintendo's hugely popular and influential video game console system considered\
  \ as technological device and social phenomenon. The Nintendo Wii, introduced in\
  \ 2006, helped usher in a moment of retro-reinvention in video game play. This hugely\
  \ popular console system, codenamed Revolution during development, signaled a turn\
  \ away from fully immersive, time-consuming MMORPGs or forty-hour FPS games and\
  \ back toward family fun in the living room. Players using the wireless motion-sensitive\
  \ controller (the Wii Remote, or “Wiimote”) play with their whole bodies, waving,\
  \ swinging, swaying. The mimetic interface shifts attention from what's on the screen\
  \ to what's happening in physical space. This book describes the Wii's impact in\
  \ technological, social, and cultural terms, examining the Wii as a system of interrelated\
  \ hardware and software that was consciously designed to promote social play in\
  \ physical space. Each chapter of Codename Revolution focuses on a major component\
  \ of the Wii as a platform: the console itself, designed to be low-powered and nimble;\
  \ the iconic Wii Remote; Wii Fit Plus, and its controller, the Wii Balance Board;\
  \ the Wii Channels interface and Nintendo's distribution system; and the Wii as\
  \ a social platform that not only affords multiplayer options but also encourages\
  \ social interaction in shared physical space. Finally, the authors connect the\
  \ Wii's revolution in mimetic interface gaming—which eventually led to the release\
  \ of Sony's Move and Microsoft's Kinect—to some of the economic and technological\
  \ conditions that influence the possibility of making something new in this arena\
  \ of computing and culture."
