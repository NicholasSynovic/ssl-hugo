abstract: Hundreds of millions of network cameras have been installed throughout the
  world. Each is capable of providing a vast amount of real-time data. Analyzing the
  massive data generated by these cameras requires significant computational resources
  and the demands may vary over time. Cloud computing shows the most promise to provide
  the needed resources on demand. In this paper, we investigate how to allocate cloud
  resources when analyzing real-time data streams from network cameras. A resource
  manager considers many factors that affect its decisions, including the types of
  analysis, the number of data streams, and the locations of the cameras. The manager
  then selects the most cost-efficient types of cloud instances (e.g., central processing
  unit versus general-purpose graphics processing units) to meet the computational
  demands for analyzing streams. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach using
  Amazon Web Services. Experiments demonstrate more than 50% cost reduction for real
  workloads.
