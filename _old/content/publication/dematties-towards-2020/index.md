abstract: The interdisciplinary field of neuroscience has made significantprogress
  in recent decades, providing the scientific community in gen-eral with a new level
  of understanding on how the brain works beyondthe store-and-fire model found in
  traditional neural networks. Mean-while, Machine Learning (ML) based on established
  models has seena surge of interest in the High Performance Computing (HPC) com-munity,
  especially through the use of high-end accelerators, such asGraphical Processing
  Units (GPUs), including HPC clusters of same.In our work, we are motivated to exploit
  these high-performance com-puting developments and understand the scaling challenges
  for new–biologically inspired–learning models on leadership-class HPC resources.These
  emerging models feature sparse and random connectivity pro-files that map to more
  loosely-coupled parallel architectures with alarge number of CPU cores per node.
  Contrasted with traditional MLcodes, these methods exploit loosely-coupled sparse
  data structures asopposed to tightly-coupled dense matrix computations, which benefitfrom
  SIMD-style parallelism found on GPUs. In this paper we introducea hybrid Message
  Passing Interface (MPI) and Open Multi-Processing(OpenMP) parallelization scheme
  to accelerate and scale our computa-tional model based on the dynamics of cortical
  tissue. We ran compu-tational tests on a leadership class visualization and analysis
  cluster atArgonne National Laboratory. We include a study of strong and weakscaling,
  where we obtained parallel efficiency measures with a minimumabove 87% and a maximum
  above 97% for simulations of our biologicallyinspired neural network on up to 64
  computing nodes running 8 threadseach. This study shows promise of the MPI+OpenMP
  hybrid approachto support flexible and biologically-inspired computational experimen-tal
  scenarios. In addition, we present the viability in the application ofthese strategies
  in high-end leadership computers in the future.
