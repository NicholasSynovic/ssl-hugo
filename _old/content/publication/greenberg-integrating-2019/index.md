abstract: This paper shows how students can be guided to integrate elementary mathematical
  analyses with motion planning for typical educational robots. Rather than using
  calculus as in comprehensive works on motion planning, we show students can achieve
  interesting results using just simple linear regression tools and trigonometric
  analyses. Experiments with one robotics platform show that use of these tools can
  lead to passable navigation through dead reckoning even if students have limited
  experience with use of sensors, programming, and mathematics.
