abstract: Energy efficiency is critical for running computer vision on battery-powered
  systems, such as mobile phones or UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles, or drones). This
  book collects the methods that have won the annual IEEE Low-Power Computer Vision
  Challenges since 2015. The winners share their solutions and provide insight on
  how to improve the efficiency of machine learning systems.
