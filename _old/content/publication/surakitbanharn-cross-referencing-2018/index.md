abstract: Physical media (like surveillance cameras) and social media (like Instagram
  and Twitter) may both be useful in attaining on-the-ground information during an
  emergency or disaster situation. However, the intersection and reliability of both
  surveillance cameras and social media during a natural disaster are not fully understood.
  To address this gap, we tested whether social media is of utility when physical
  surveillance cameras went off-line during Hurricane Irma in 2017. Specifically,
  we collected and compared geo-tagged Instagram and Twitter posts in the state of
  Florida during times and in areas where public surveillance cameras went off-line.
  We report social media content and frequency and content to determine the utility
  for emergency managers or first responders during a natural disaster.
