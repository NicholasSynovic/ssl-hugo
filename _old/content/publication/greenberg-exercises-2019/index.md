abstract: This Innovative Practice Work in Progress presents progress in developing
  exercises for high school students incorporating level-appropriate mathematics into
  robotics activities. We assume mathematical foundations ranging from algebra to
  precalculus, whereas most prior work on integrating mathematics into robotics uses
  only very elementary mathematical reasoning or, at the other extreme, is comprised
  of technical papers or books using calculus and other advanced mathematics. The
  exercises suggested are relevant to any differential-drive robot, which is an appropriate
  model for many different varieties of educational robots. They guide students towards
  comparing a variety of natural navigational strategies making use of typical movement
  primitives. The exercises align with Common Core State Standards for Mathematics.
