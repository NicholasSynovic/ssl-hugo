abstract: COVID-19 has resulted in a worldwide pandemic, leading to \"lockdown\" policies
  and social distancing. The pandemic has profoundly changed the world. Traditional
  methods for observing these historical events are difficult because sending reporters
  to areas with many infected people can put the reporters' lives in danger. New technologies
  are needed for safely observing responses to these policies. This paper reports
  using thousands of network cameras deployed worldwide for the purpose of witnessing
  activities in response to the policies. The network cameras can continuously provide
  real-time visual data (image and video) without human efforts. Thus, network cameras
  can be utilized to observe activities without risking the lives of reporters. This
  paper describes a project that uses network cameras to observe responses to governments'
  policies during the COVID-19 pandemic (March to April in 2020). The project discovers
  over 30,000 network cameras deployed in 110 countries. A set of computer tools are
  created to collect visual data from network cameras continuously during the pandemic.
  This paper describes the methods to discover network cameras on the Internet, the
  methods to collect and manage data, and preliminary results of data analysis. This
  project can be the foundation for observing the possible \"second wave\" in fall
  2020. The data may be used for post-pandemic analysis by sociologists, public health
  experts, and meteorologists.
