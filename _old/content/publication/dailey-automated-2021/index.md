abstract: Reduction in the cost of Network Cameras along with a rise in connectivity
  enables entities all around the world to deploy vast arrays of camera networks.
  Network cameras offer real-time visual data that can be used for studying traffic
  patterns, emergency response, security, and other applications. Although many sources
  of Network Camera data are available, collecting the data remains difficult due
  to variations in programming interface and website structures. Previous solutions
  rely on manually parsing the target website, taking many hours to complete. We create
  a general and automated solution for aggregating Network Camera data spread across
  thousands of uniquely structured webpages. We analyze heterogeneous webpage structures
  and identify common characteristics among 73 sample Network Camera websites (each
  website has multiple web pages). These characteristics are then used to build an
  automated camera discovery module that crawls and aggregates Network Camera data.
  Our system successfully extracts 57,364 Network Cameras from 237,257 unique web
  pages.
