abstract: 'Racing the Beam: The Atari Video Computer System,by Ian Bogost and Nick
  Montfort, inaugurated thePlatform Studies series at MIT Press in 2009.We’ve coauthored
  a new book in the series, Codename: Revolution: the Nintendo Wii Video Game Console.
  Platform studies is a quintessentially Digital Humanities approach, since it’s explicitly
  focused on the interrelationship of computing and cultural expression. According
  to the series preface, the goal of platform studies is “to consider the lowest level
  of computing systems and to understand how these systems relate to culture and creativity.”In
  practice, this involves paying close attentionto specific hardware and software
  interactions–to the vertical relationships between a platform’s multilayered materialities
  (Hayles; Kirschenbaum),from transistors to code to cultural reception. Any given
  act of platform-studies analysis may focus for example on the relationship between
  the chipset and the OS, or between the graphics processor and display parameters
  or game developers’ designs.In computing terms, platform is an abstraction(Bogost
  and Montfort), a pragmatic frame placed around whatever hardware-and-software configuration
  is required in order to build or run certain specificapplications (including creative
  works). The object of platform studies is thus a shifting series of possibility
  spaces, any number of dynamic thresholds between discrete levels of a system.'
