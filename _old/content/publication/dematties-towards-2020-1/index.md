abstract: "Presentation at CyberColombia's Third HPC Summer School: Bio and Data Science\
  \ Part 1 describes our work on developing a neurocomputational model inspired in\
  \ specific features found in the mammalian cortex. Part 2 describes our software\
  \ development efforts to build an HPC version of our work aimed at scalability on\
  \ leadership class supercomputers, including a discussion of our strong and weak\
  \ scaling results to date. Part 3 describes our efforts with software engineering\
  \ and reproducibilty with a discussion of best practices for working with open source\
  \ and hosting code, datasets, and analyses."
