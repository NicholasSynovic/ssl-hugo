abstract: In this paper, we address the detection of rogue autonomous vehicles using
  an integrated approach involving computer vision, activity monitoring and contextual
  information. The proposed approach can be used to detect rogue autonomous vehicles
  using sensors installed on observer vehicles that are used to monitor and identify
  the behavior of other autonomous vehicles operating on the road. The safe braking
  distance and the safe following time are computed to identify if an autonomous vehicle
  is behaving properly. Our preliminary results show that there is a wide variation
  in both the safe following time and the safe braking distance recorded using three
  autonomous vehicles in a test-bed. These initial results show significant progress
  for the future efforts to coordinate the operation of autonomous, semi-autonomous
  and non-autonomous vehicles.
