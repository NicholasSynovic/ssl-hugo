abstract: One of the greatest technological improvements in recent years is the rapid
  progress using machine learning for processing visual data. Among all factors that
  contribute to this development, datasets with labels play crucial roles. Several
  datasets are widely reused for investigating and analyzing different solutions in
  machine learning. Many systems, such as autonomous vehicles, rely on components
  using machine learning for recognizing objects. This paper compares different visual
  datasets and frameworks for machine learning. The comparison is both qualitative
  and quantitative and investigates object detection labels with respect to size,
  location, and contextual information. This paper also presents a new approach creating
  datasets using real-time, geo-tagged visual data, greatly improving the contextual
  information of the data. The data could be automatically labeled by cross-referencing
  information from other sources (such as weather).
