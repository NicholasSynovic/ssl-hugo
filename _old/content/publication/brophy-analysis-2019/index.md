abstract: Previous research provides a method for reducing the subjectivity in molar
  tooth identification of animals in the family Bovidae, by quantifying the occlusal
  surface of teeth using elliptical Fourier analysis. This current paper specifically
  tests what effect teeth with medium to late wear have on the identification of bovid
  teeth when using the form (size and shape) of the occlusal surface to classify specimens.
