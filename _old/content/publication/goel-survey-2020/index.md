abstract: 'Deep neural networks (DNNs) are successful in many computer vision tasks.
  However, the most accurate DNNs require millions of parameters and operations, making
  them energy, computation and memory intensive. This impedes the deployment of large
  DNNs in low-power devices with limited compute resources. Recent research improves
  DNN models by reducing the memory requirement, energy consumption, and number of
  operations without significantly decreasing the accuracy. This paper surveys the
  progress of low-power deep learning and computer vision, specifically in regards
  to inference, and discusses the methods for compacting and accelerating DNN models.
  The techniques can be divided into four major categories: (1) parameter quantization
  and pruning, (2) compressed convolutional filters and matrix factorization, (3)
  network architecture search, and (4) knowledge distillation. We analyze the accuracy,
  advantages, disadvantages, and potential solutions to the problems with the techniques
  in each category. We also discuss new evaluation metrics as a guideline for future
  research.'
