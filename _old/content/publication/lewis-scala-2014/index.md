abstract: 'Scala is one of a new breed of hybrid languages with both object-oriented
  and functional aspects. It happens to be the most successful of these languages
  coming in at #12 on the Red Monk language ranking and leading all languages in their
  2nd tier. This workshop will introduce participants to the Scala programming language,
  how it can be used effectively in introductory CS courses, and the parallel tools
  that are available for it. We begin with simple examples in the REPL and scripting
  environment, then look at doing larger, object-oriented projects. We finish off
  with an exploration of composable futures and the Akka actor library. Participants
  are strongly recommended to bring a laptop.'
