abstract: "Background: Developers face challenges in building high-quality research\
  \ software due to its inherent complexity. These challenges can reduce the confidence\
  \ users have in the quality of the result produced by the software. Use of a defined\
  \ software development process, which divides the development into distinct phases,\
  \ results in improved design, more trustworthy results, and better project management.\
  \ Aims: This paper focuses on gaining a better understanding of the use of software\
  \ development process for research software. Method: We surveyed research software\
  \ developers to collect information about their use of software development processes.\
  \ We analyze whether and demographic factors influence the respondents' use of and\
  \ perceived value in defined process. Results: Based on 98 responses, research software\
  \ developers appear to follow a defined software development process at least some\
  \ of the time. The respondents also have a strong positive perception about the\
  \ value of following processes. Conclusions: To produce high-quality and reliable\
  \ research software, which is critical for many research domains, research software\
  \ developers must follow a proper software development process. The results indicate\
  \ a positive perception of value about using defined development processes that\
  \ should lead to both short-term benefits through improved results and long-term\
  \ benefits through more maintainable software."
