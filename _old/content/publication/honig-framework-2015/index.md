abstract: Academic courses focused on individual microcomputers or client/server applications
  are no longer sufficient for students to develop knowledge in embedded systems.
  Current and near-term industrial systems employ multiple interacting components
  and new network and security approaches; hence, academic preparation requires teaching
  students to develop realistic projects comparable to these real-world products.
  However, the complexity, breadth, and technical variations of these real-world products
  are difficult to reproduce in the classroom. This paper outlines preliminary work
  on a framework architecture suitable for academic teaching of modern embedded systems
  including the Internet of Things. It defines four layers, two of which are at the
  edges of the network, and not adequately covered in academia. For each layer of
  the architecture, specific technology and suitable devices are identified. Desired
  academic outcomes for courses using projects based on the architecture are identified.
  Feedback and comparison is sought on how effective student course and research activities
  based on the framework will be to real-world embedded systems developers.
