abstract: "Various hybrid-paradigm languages, designed to balance compile-time error\
  \ detection, conciseness, and performance, have emerged. Scala, e.g., is interoperable\
  \ with Java and has become an early leader in adoption, especially in the start-up\
  \ and open-source spaces. Workshop participants experience Scala's value as a teaching\
  \ language in the CS curriculum through four lecture-lab modules: In CS1, the read-eval-print\
  \ loop and simple, uniform syntax aid programming in the small. In CS2, higher-order\
  \ methods allow concise, efficient manipulation of collections. Advanced topics\
  \ include domain-specific languages, concurrency, web apps/services, and mobile\
  \ apps. Laptop recommended with Scala installed."
