abstract: Many computational theories have been developed to improve artificial phonetic
  classification performance from linguistic auditory streams. However, less attention
  has been given to psycholinguistic data and neurophysiological features recently
  found in cortical tissue. We focus on a context in which basic linguistic units–such
  as phonemes–are extracted and robustly classified by humans and other animals from
  complex acoustic streams in speech data. We are especially motivated by the fact
  that 8-month-old human infants can accomplish segmentation of words from fluent
  audio streams based exclusively on the statistical relationships between neighboring
  speech sounds without any kind of supervision. In this paper, we introduce a biologically
  inspired and fully unsupervised neurocomputational approach that incorporates key
  neurophysiological and anatomical cortical properties, including columnar organization,
  spontaneous micro-columnar formation, adaptation to contextual activations and Sparse
  Distributed Representations (SDRs) produced by means of partial N-Methyl-D-aspartic
  acid (NMDA) depolarization. Its feature abstraction capabilities show promising
  phonetic invariance and generalization attributes. Our model improves the performance
  of a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier for monosyllabic, disyllabic and trisyllabic
  word classification tasks in the presence of environmental disturbances such as
  white noise, reverberation, and pitch and voice variations. Furthermore, our approach
  emphasizes potential self-organizing cortical principles achieving improvement without
  any kind of optimization guidance which could minimize hypothetical loss functions
  by means of–for example–backpropagation. Thus, our computational model outperforms
  multiresolution spectro-temporal auditory feature representations using only the
  statistical sequential structure immerse in the phonotactic rules of the input stream.
