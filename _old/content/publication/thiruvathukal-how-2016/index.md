abstract: 'As sci-fi readers and film buffs know, many of these ideas that have been
  foreshadowed–and that seem far-fetched in–fiction are beginning to seem possible.
  Whether we are considering the benevolent Commander Data in Star Trek: The Next
  Generation or fearing the terrifying Terminator, we are entering an era where AI
  as is rapidly entering the public discourse.'
