abstract: Machine learning techniques are becoming a fundamental tool for scientific
  and engineering progress. These techniques are applied in contexts as diverse as
  astronomy and spam filtering. However, correctly applying these techniques requires
  careful engineering. Much attention has been paid to the technical potential; relatively
  little attention has been paid to the software engineering process required to bring
  research-based machine learning techniques into practical utility. Technology companies
  have supported the engineering community through machine learning frameworks such
  as TensorFLow and PyTorch, but the details of how to engineer complex machine learning
  models in these frameworks have remained hidden. To promote best practices within
  the engineering community, academic institutions and Google have partnered to launch
  a Special Interest Group on Machine Learning Models (SIGMODELS) whose goal is to
  develop exemplary implementations of prominent machine learning models in community
  locations such as the TensorFlow Model Garden (TFMG). The purpose of this report
  is to define a process for reproducing a state-of-the-art machine learning model
  at a level of quality suitable for inclusion in the TFMG. We define the engineering
  process and elaborate on each step, from paper analysis to model release. We report
  on our experiences implementing the YOLO model family with a team of 26 student
  researchers, share the tools we developed, and describe the lessons we learned along
  the way.
