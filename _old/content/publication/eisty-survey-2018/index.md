abstract: 'Background: Breakthroughs in research increasingly depend on complex software
  libraries, tools, and applications aimed at supporting specific science, engineering,
  business, or humanities disciplines. The complexity and criticality of this software
  motivate the need for ensuring quality and reliability. Software metrics are a key
  tool for assessing, measuring, and understanding software quality and reliability.
  Aims: The goal of this work is to better understand how research software developers
  use traditional software engineering concepts, like metrics, to support and evaluate
  both the software and the software development process. One key aspect of this goal
  is to identify how the set of metrics relevant to research software corresponds
  to the metrics commonly used in traditional software engineering. Method: We surveyed
  research software developers to gather information about their knowledge and use
  of code metrics and software process metrics. We also analyzed the influence of
  demographics (project size, development role, and development stage) on these metrics.
  Results: The survey results, from 129 respondents, indicate that respondents have
  a general knowledge of metrics. However, their knowledge of specific SE metrics
  is lacking, their use even more limited. The most used metrics relate to performance
  and testing. Even though code complexity often poses a significant challenge to
  research software development, respondents did not indicate much use of code metrics.
  Conclusions: Research software developers appear to be interested and see some value
  in software metrics but may be encountering roadblocks when trying to use them.
  Further study is needed to determine the extent to which these metrics could provide
  value in continuous process improvement.'
