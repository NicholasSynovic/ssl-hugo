abstract: In order to reconstruct environments associated with Plio-Pleistocene hominins
  in southern Africa, researchers frequently rely upon the animals associated with
  the hominins, in particular, animals in the Family Bovidae. Bovids in southern Africa
  are typically identified by their teeth. However, identifying the taxon of a bovid
  tooth is challenging due to various biasing factors. Furthermore, inaccurate identification
  of fossil bovids can have significant consequences on the reconstructed paleoenvironment.
  Recent research on the classification of bovid fossil teeth has relied on using
  elliptical Fourier analysis to summarize the shape of the outline of the occlusal
  surface of the tooth and the resulting harmonic amplitudes. Currently, an expert
  in the field must manually place landmarks around the edges of each tooth which
  is slow and time consuming. This study tests whether it is possible to crowdsource
  this task, while maintaining the necessary level of quality needed to perform a
  statistical analysis on each tooth. Amazon Mechanical Turk workers place landmarks
  on the edge of the tooth which is compared to the performance of an expert in the
  field. The results suggest that crowdsourcing the digitization process is reliable
  and replicable. With the technical aspects of digitization managed, researchers
  can concentrate on analyzing and interpreting the data.
