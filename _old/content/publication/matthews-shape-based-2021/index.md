abstract: We consider the problem of classifying curves when they are observed only
  partially on their parameter domains. We propose computational methods for (i) completion
  of partially observed curves; (ii) assessment of completion variability through
  a nonparametric multiple imputation procedure; (iii) development of nearest neighbor
  classifiers compatible with the completion techniques. Our contributions are founded
  on exploiting the geometric notion of shape of a curve, defined as those aspects
  of a curve that remain unchanged under translations, rotations and reparameterizations.
  Explicit incorporation of shape information into the computational methods plays
  the dual role of limiting the set of all possible completions of a curve to those
  with similar shape while simultaneously enabling more efficient use of training
  data in the classifier through shape-informed neighborhoods. Our methods are then
  used for taxonomic classification of partially observed curves arising from images
  of fossilized Bovidae teeth, obtained from a novel anthropological application concerning
  paleoenvironmental reconstruction.
