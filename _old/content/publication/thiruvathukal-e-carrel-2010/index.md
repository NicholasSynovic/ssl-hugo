abstract: The E-Carrel project aims to address the preservation of, access to, and
  re-uses of humanities electronic text files. It enables dynamic, growing resource
  projects as repositories for new knowledge. It provides for on-line distributed
  data and tools that are open to new scholarly enhancement through a user friendly
  tagging tool, sophisticated use of stand-off markup and annotation (leveraging RDF
  capabilities), and a browsing system anyone can use. It creates a secure system
  of text preparation and dissemination that encourages collaboration and participation
  by anyone interested in the texts. To insure the endurance of authenticated texts,
  multiple copies are distributed on the Internet. Foundation texts anchor a system
  for maintaining and growing project usefulness beyond the originators&rsquo; interest
  and the functions they imagined. Increasing access to humanities texts as useful,
  adaptable, reliable source materials that can be re-purposed will increase interest
  in continued maintenance, which are critical for long-term preservation and access.
